    " - The dataframe will consist of three columns: PostalCode, Borough, and Neighborhood\n",
    " - Only process the cells that have an assigned borough. Ignore cells with a borough that is Not assigned.\n",
    " - More than one neighborhood can exist in one postal code area. For example, in the table on the Wikipedia page, you will notice that M5A is listed twice and has two neighborhoods:  Harbourfront and Regent Park. These two rows will be combined into one row with the neighborhoods separated with a comma as shown in row 11 in the above table.\n",
    " - If a cell has a borough but a Not assigned neighborhood, then the neighborhood will be the same as the borough.\n",

However, recently Google started charging for their API: http://geoawesomeness.com/developers-up-in-arms-over-google-maps-api-insane-price-hike/, so we will use the Geocoder Python package instead: https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/index.html.\n",

So, in order to make sure that you get the coordinates for all of our neighborhoods, you can run a while loop for each postal code. \n",
